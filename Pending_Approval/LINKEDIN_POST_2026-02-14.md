# LinkedIn Post — February 14, 2026

This week, we hit a major milestone with our AI Employee automation system—41 completed tasks and zero bottlenecks. Our Gmail and WhatsApp watchers are running flawlessly on PM2, automatically processing inbound messages and routing them to the right teams. We've also strengthened our token refresh handling to ensure uninterrupted service, even in headless environments.

Here's what we learned: **The secret to inbox sanity isn't working harder—it's automating smarter.** Most small business email gets lost in noise or creates unnecessary context-switching. By intelligently filtering and classifying messages upfront, you reclaim focus for what actually moves the needle. Our system processed 38 messages yesterday alone, intelligently separating signal from noise so our teams never miss what matters.

Ready to reclaim your team's time? Let's build you an AI Employee that handles your communication workflow. Whether it's Gmail automation, WhatsApp integration, or smart approval routing, we can customize a solution that scales with your business.

DM me to chat about your workflow.
