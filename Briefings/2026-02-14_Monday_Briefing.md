## 3. Bottlenecks & Issues

🚨 **Critical:**
- **$3,100 in unpaid invoices** — Zero collections from Feb invoices. Immediate payment follow-up required.
- **Revenue shortfall:** $1,900 below monthly target with ~2 weeks remaining in February.

⚠️ **Operational:**
- 5 pending WhatsApp messages and 1 tweet draft awaiting approval/review
- Lead generation activity not visible in current data

## 4. Social Media Summary

**Pending Items:**
- 1 tweet draft awaiting approval (TWEET_DRAFT_1771088552.md)
- 4 pending WhatsApp messages queued for delivery

**Status:** Limited social media activity logged. Online presence building efforts appear nascent.

## 5. Cost-Saving Suggestions

1. **Odoo Self-Hosted:** ✅ Already implemented (Docker-based, no licensing costs)
2. **Claude API Usage:** Monitor API consumption trends — consider request optimization if spending grows
3. **Infrastructure:** Currently zero hardware costs (WSL2 environment). Scalable without additional infrastructure spend.

**Recommendation:** Focus cost efforts on revenue generation rather than cost reduction at current stage.

## 6. Upcoming Deadlines (Next 14 Days)

- **Client Deliverables:** Due within next 2 weeks (specifics pending — update Business_Goals.md with details)
- **End of February:** Month-end close and reporting (Feb 28, 2026)
- **Invoice Collections:** Priority — follow up on $3,100 outstanding from Acme Corp and Test Customer LLC

1. Contact Acme Corp and Test Customer LLC for payment confirmation
